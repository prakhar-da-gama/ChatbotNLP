# ChatbotNLP
I have used NLTK and Tensor to train a JSON format model for this chatbot
The chatbot has been trained specifically for Science based questions eg"who was the first man to land on moon ?", "what is the tallest grass on earth ?" etc.
In the sub directory train_data.py has the main algorithm for the project and intents.json is the initial data to feed.
